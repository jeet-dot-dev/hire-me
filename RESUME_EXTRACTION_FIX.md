# Resume Text Extraction - Production Fix

## Problem
The resume text extraction was failing in production with the error: "Could not process your resume. Please try uploading a different file or try again later."

## Root Causes Fixed

### 1. File System Dependencies
- **Issue**: Original code used `fs`, `createWriteStream`, `mkdir`, `unlink` which don't work in serverless environments
- **Fix**: Switched to in-memory processing using ArrayBuffer

### 2. PDF Library Compatibility
- **Issue**: `pdfjs-dist` had compatibility issues in Node.js serverless environments
- **Fix**: Reverted to `pdf2json` with proper dynamic imports

### 3. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Generic error messages made debugging difficult
- **Fix**: Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios

## Key Improvements

✅ **Memory-based Processing**: No temporary files, everything in memory  
✅ **Better Error Messages**: Specific errors for file not found, timeout, corrupted files  
✅ **Increased File Size Limit**: Raised from 5MB to 10MB  
✅ **Better Timeout Handling**: 2-minute timeout with proper error messages  
✅ **Privacy-conscious Logging**: Masks filenames in logs  
✅ **Fallback Mechanism**: Secondary extraction method for problematic PDFs  
✅ **Content Validation**: Ensures extracted text meets minimum quality requirements  

## Supported File Types
- ✅ PDF (with fallback extraction)
- ✅ DOCX (Microsoft Word)
- ⚠️ DOC (limited support, recommends DOCX)

## Error Messages Users Will See
- File not found errors → "Resume file not found. Please upload your resume again."
- Timeout errors → "Download timeout. Please check your internet connection."
- Large file errors → "Resume file is too large (XMB). Maximum allowed size is 10MB."
- Corrupted/password-protected PDFs → "PDF file is password protected" or "No readable text found"
- Unsupported formats → "Unsupported file format. Supported formats: PDF, DOCX"

## Technical Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `components/interview/functions/extractResumeText.ts` - Complete rewrite for production compatibility
2. `app/api/extractResumeText/route.ts` - Updated to use the new extraction function
3. `next.config.ts` - Added webpack configuration for PDF.js (though now using pdf2json)

### Dependencies:
- Already installed: `pdf2json`, `mammoth`, `axios`, `axios-retry`
- No new packages required

## Testing
✅ Build test passed  
✅ TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ No lint errors  

The application is now ready for production deployment and should handle resume extraction much more reliably.
