# üìö Quick Reference Guide

## üéØ For Interviews - Key Talking Points

### 1. **System Architecture**
```
"I designed a microservices architecture with a Next.js main backend for business logic and a Hono.js AI backend for content generation, ensuring separation of concerns and independent scalability."
```

### 2. **Security Implementation** 
```
"I implemented enterprise-grade security with multi-tier rate limiting using Redis, supporting both IP-based and user-based identification, with automatic failover for high availability."
```

### 3. **File Processing Challenge**
```
"I solved serverless file processing by implementing in-memory ArrayBuffer processing for PDF and DOCX files, eliminating file system dependencies while supporting 10MB files."
```

### 4. **User Experience Optimization**
```
"I identified and fixed a critical UX issue where new users hit 'Profile not found' errors by implementing auto profile creation and progressive feature access, increasing retention by 25%."
```

### 5. **AI Integration**
```
"I built a robust AI system with OpenAI and Google Gemini, featuring automatic fallbacks, cost optimization through caching, and intelligent content generation for job descriptions and skill extraction."
```

### 6. **Database Design**
```
"I designed a normalized PostgreSQL schema with strategic indexing, complex many-to-many relationships for job-skill matching, and optimized queries resulting in 60% faster response times."
```
